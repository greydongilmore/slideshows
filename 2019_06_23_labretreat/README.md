#### What is DBS?
**DBS, short for Deep Brain Stiumation,** is is an established surgical treatment for people with movement disroders, such as Parkinson's disease and dystonia. It involves implanting electrodes (thin metal wires) within certain areas of the brain and sending electrical impulses through these electrodes.

#### What is DBS Guide?
DBS Guide is a surgical planning and postoperative assessmen that can be incorporated into 3D Slicer as an extension module. DBS Guide works to visualize the postoperative localization of the microelectrodes in the patient's brain, by displaying the microelectrodes on the patient's MRI and/or CT scans. Analyzing the visualization that DBS Guide provides, it can be determined if the microelectrodes have been implanted successfully at the planned target area, the subthalamaic nucleus (STN).
